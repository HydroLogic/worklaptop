# Flood Damage Functions:

James 1972 uses the aggregate formula:

    C = totdmg per event
    K = flddmg / (ft flddpth @ mktvalue str)
    U = fraction of fldpln in urban area
    M = mktvalue of str inundation ($/developed acre)
    h = avg dpth in ft
    A = area flded in acres

    *C=KUMhA*  [1](http://www.pwut.ac.ir/FA/Staff/Alimohammadi/Files/Chapter%206-Risk%20Based%20Design%20of%20Flood%20Control%20Structures.pdf)

## Types of Uncertainty

* Function uncertainty (distribution uncertainty / model uncertainty) - the uncertainty in the model. arises from incomplete scientific/technical understanding.
* Parameter - quantity that describes the relationship of a known input and unknown output.
    Example: Mannings in the energy loss calc. this value determines the relationshop b/t spec Q and unknwn energy loss by the reach.

* Sensitivity analysis - the effect on the output by input value changes
* Exceedance prob - prob of spec magnitude will be exceeded
* Median exceed prob - in a sample of estimates of exceedance probs of a specified magnitude, this value is exceeded 50% of the time
* Capacity exceedence - the exceedence of the capacity of water the system is designed for

#### Stage-Damage Fxn (SDF)
The stage damage function is the summary of the direct economic cost of flood inundation for specific reach














### Vocabulary

* Culmulative distribution function (cdf):
