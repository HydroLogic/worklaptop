* **Assurance (Conditional Non-Exceedance Probability) ** - Probability that a target stage will not be exceeded during a flood event of specific interval. A performance measure which represents the performance of a system during a single event
  * ex: USACE requires levees must have ~ 90% chance of not being overtopped when subjected to 100yr (1% annual exceedence) flood

* **Capacity Exceedance** - the capacity of a system (dam/levee/damage reduction measure)
* **Expected Annual Damage (EAD)** - the integral of the damage-probability function. Equal to the average or mean of all possible values of damage determined by Monte Carlo sampling of discharge-exceedance probability, stage-discharge, and stage-damage relationships and their associated uncertainties.
* **Fragility Curve** - A function that defines the probability of failure as a function of an applied load level.
* **Freeboard** - the levee height above the design flood height to increase the liklihood of the design event being contained without overtopping.
* **Median Exceedance Probability** - In a sample of estimates of exceedance probability of a specific magnitude, this is the value that is exceeded by 50% of the estimates
* **Residual Risk** - Risk that remains if a proposed damage reduction project is exceeded. The inundation risk in the leveed area. Includes *Transformed Risk*
* **Sensitivity Analysis** - Computation of the effect on the output with changes to input values or assumptions. An analysis to determine the rate at which an output changes given small changes to input.
* **Transferred Risk** - The change in risk in one location due to implementation of a risk reduction action in another. Actions usually shift the risk burden to another region. Newton's third law
* **Transformed Risk** - The risk that is transformed when a hazard reduction method is implemented. The presence of a levee can mean that inundation depths increase in a breach or failure. A new emergance of risk from other risk reduction methods.
